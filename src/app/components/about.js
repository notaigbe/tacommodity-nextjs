                Women Sustainable Group is promoted by TA Commodity Producers Co
                Nig Limited for women farmers. This group brings together women
                and youths in agriculture especially smallholder farmers into
                various cooperatives, and associations, for the purpose of
                creating access to training, market and finance so as to achieve
                sustainable business enterprises amongst women and youths
                farmers predominantly in the rural areas.

              <p>
                Port Harcourt Agro Commodity Multipurpose Cooperative Limited
                was born out of such women sustainable group. The focus of the
                group is to target the sustainability of fish farmers in the
                rural areas of Niger Delta areas especially Rivers State where
                women and youths are neglected because of Oil exploration
                activities by Multi-National Companies. Another major focus of
                this group, is to improve livelihood income of rural fish
                farmers through access to training, market and finance.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                This cooperative helps smallholder fish farmers increase their
                access and improve their negotiating power with respect to
                acquiring a wide range of services including knowledge and
                extension services; productive assets such as seeds and tools;
                and marketing information and skills to capture greater value
                from the sales of their products.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                As sustainability-focused group, the cooperative increases
                community awareness of protected land areas, clean water,
                education in nutrition and making sure there is a clean
                environment and a productive farm to pass down to future
                generations.
